# ColorGame

2D scroller platform game designed to teach players about basic color theory.

..* Vertical Walls (or Doors) can be passed through if the character is the **same** color as the wall.
..* Horizontal Platforms can be stood upon if the character is the **complement** color of the platform.

###Levels
1. Tutorial Level: Only black and white colors are available to introduce idea of complements.
2. Primary: The 3 primary colors are introduced, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and their complements/secondary colors.
